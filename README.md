# Pizza Sales
In this project, I used SQL to analyze a pizza dataset and derive insights by answering a series of business-related questions. The analysis involved:

- Basic insights like the total number of orders placed, total revenue generated, and identifying the highest-priced pizza, the most common pizza size, and the top 5 most ordered pizzas.
- Intermediate insights where I joined tables to calculate the total quantity of pizzas ordered by category, examined order distribution by time, and analyzed category-wise pizza distribution. I also calculated the average number of pizzas ordered per day and identified the top 3 pizzas generating the most revenue.
- Advanced insights included calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue, analyzing cumulative revenue over time, and identifying the top 3 pizzas by revenue for each category.

This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to answer both basic and advanced business questions by extracting meaningful insights from the data, helping in areas like sales optimization, inventory planning, and revenue analysis.
